# 👋 Hey, I’m Cabuco

<sub>*This README was AI-assisted. Human-approved. Slightly overthought.*</sub>

Senior IT Support Specialist by title.  
In practice, I’m very much a **Guy in the Chair**.

I sit just off-screen, watching dashboards, logs, and timelines — feeding the right information at the right moment so things don’t blow up (or so they blow up *less*).

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- Support complex enterprise environments (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Okta, Slack, Zoom, etc.)
- Untangle cross-platform issues that only show up when everything is “configured correctly”
- Anticipate failure modes before they become incidents
- Translate between IT, Legal, Security, and end users so everyone can keep moving

If you’re in the field trying to save the day, I’m probably in the background saying  
“Okay, pause — here’s what’s actually happening.”

---

## 🛠️ My Toolkit (and Why It Matters)
- Identity & Access (SSO, provisioning, migrations, edge cases no one documented)
- Email & calendar migrations (including explaining why *sync* is not a promise)
- Google Workspace administration (custom schemas, GAM, audits, forensic visibility)
- Asset lifecycle & logistics (deployment → replacement → legal hold → international return)
- Incident response that favors calm, clarity, and decisive info

I don’t swing the hammer unless it’s needed.  
I make sure the person who does has the right target.

---

## 🧩 What I Optimize For
- Signal over noise
- Boring reliability
- Clear ownership and sane defaults
- Systems that fail *predictably*, not creatively
- Humans not being punished by the tools meant to help them

---

## 🚫 Things I’m Not Trying to Be
- A full-time scripter (automation is a tool, not my personality)
- The loudest voice in the room

---

## 🎮 When I’m Not in the Chair
- Disney and the MCU (Spider-Man especially — obviously)
- K-pop (ILLIT has permanent brain residency)
- Over-researching menus before ordering
- Optimizing credit card benefits like it’s a mini-game
- Asking “wait… why?” until the root cause gives up

---

## 📍 Current Status
Operating in environments that are “mostly fine” until they need someone behind the scenes.

---

## 🧾 Operating Principle
> The best heroes aren’t always visible.  
> Sometimes they’re the reason the mission works at all.
> Never say, "I don't know." Always say, "I'll find out."

If you value preparation, clear comms, and systems that don’t panic — we’ll get along.
